# Answer-Dependent-Multiple-Choice-Questions

## This project provides a demonstration and a template for grading Multiple-Choice Questions with R

## Grading MCQs in R provides instructors with more options when it comes to assigning points, adjusting scores, and asking questions.

## The Demonstration will walk through the process from a typical scantron output all the way through aggregate analysis of outcomes.

## This project will be maintained by Kenjiro Wake Quides Ph.D. in the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at the University of California, Davis.
